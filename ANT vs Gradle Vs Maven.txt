Apache Ant was the first among "moderan" build tools. In many aspects it is similar to make. It was released in 2000 and in a short period of time became the most popular build tool for Java projects. It has a very low learning curve thus allowing anyone to start using it without any special preparation. its based on procedural programming idea.

After its initial release, it was improved with the ability to accept plug-ins.
