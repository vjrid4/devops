GIT is a distributed version control system.

Earlier we have several version control systems in place but none of them is as famous as SVN or GIT.

All version control systems works from central repository.

1. Source Code Control system(SCCS)-1972
2. Revision Control System - 1982
3. Concurrent Version Control System(CVS) 1986-1990)
4. Apache Subversion(SVN) - 2000 Opensource
5. BitKeeper SCM -2000 - Distributed version control system - Proprietary
6. GIT - Linus Torvols - 2005

All repositories work as pull the code from central repository, make changes and submit the changes back to the central repository.

But in GIT, different users(or teams of users) maintain their own repos, instead working from a central repo. 
Changes are stored as "Change Sets" or "Patches". 
Means tracks changes, not versions7
Different from CVS and SVN, which track versions
