GIT is a distributed version control system.

Earlier we have several version control systems in place but none of them is as famous as SVN or GIT.

All version control systems works from central repository.

1. Source Code Control system(SCCS)-1972
2. Revision Control System - 1982
3. Concurrent Version Control System(CVS) 1986-1990)
4. Apache Subversion(SVN) - 2000 Opensource
5. BitKeeper SCM -2000 - Distributed version control system - Proprietary
6. GIT - Linus Torvols - 2005

All repositories work as pull the code from central repository, make changes and submit the changes back to the central repository.

But in GIT, different users(or teams of users) maintain their own repos, instead working from a central repo. 
Changes are stored as "Change Sets" or "Patches". 
Means tracks changes, not versions7
Different from CVS and SVN, which track versions

Task: How to push local directory contents to github.com

STEP 1: git init => which will initialize the local directory as a Git repo.
STEP 2: git add . =>Stage the files in the current directory to new repo
STEP 3: git commit -m "First Commit" => commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repo. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
STEP 4: to set remote github repo, copy the repo URL and execute command as 'git remote add origin https://github.com/vjrid4/devops.git'
STEP 5: To display remote URL, you can use 'git remote -v'
STEP 6: Now push the changes to remote git repo using command 'git push origin master'

git init command
Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
